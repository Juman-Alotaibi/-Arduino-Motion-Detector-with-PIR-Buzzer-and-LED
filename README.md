# -Arduino-Motion-Detector-with-PIR-Buzzer-and-LED
 A simple Arduino project that detects motion using a PIR sensor and triggers a buzzer and LED as alerts. It also prints a message to the Serial Monitor when motion is detected.
Components
Arduino Uno
PIR Motion Sensor
Buzzer
LED
220Ω Resistor
Breadboard and jumper wires

| Component  | Arduino Pin | Note               |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| PIR Sensor | D2          | Middle pin to D2   |
| Buzzer     | D8          | Positive to D8     |
| LED        | D13         | With 220Ω resistor |

▶️ How to Run
Build the circuit as shown.

Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Open the Serial Monitor.

Move in front of the sensor — the LED and buzzer will activate when motion is detected.
